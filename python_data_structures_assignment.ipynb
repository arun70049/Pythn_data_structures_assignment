    "that can store a collection of items. They are particularly useful due to their \n",

    "Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordered\n",
    "Lists maintain the order of elements.\n",
    "This means that the order in which you add items to the list is the order in which \n",
    "they are stored and retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: '''\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "''' 2. Mutable\n",
    "Lists are mutable, meaning that you can change their content after they have been created. You can add, remove, or modify items in a list.\n",

    "Examples:  '''\n",
    "\n",

    "print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 50\n",
    "print(my_list[-3:-1])  # Output: [30, 40]\n",

    "''' 6. Iterable\n",
    "Lists are iterable, which means you can use them in loops and other contexts where\n",
    "iteration is required. '''\n",
